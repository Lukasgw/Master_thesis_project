# Master_thesis_project

As part of my master's thesis, I trained an AI that is able to recognize emotions as well as mental health problems based on utterances. In this folder I have listed all necessary files to start the final app. 


To start the app you have to put all files in the same directory and make sure that all libraries from "app.py" are installed. After this you have to open a terminal and navigate to the directory, there you can start the app with the following command: 

***streamlit run app.py***
